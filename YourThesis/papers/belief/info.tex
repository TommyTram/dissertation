This paper investigates different approaches to find a safe and efficient driving strategy through an intersection with other drivers.
Because the intentions of the other drivers to yield, stop, or go are not observable, we use a particle filter to maintain a belief state. 
We study how a reinforcement learning agent can use these representations efficiently during training and evaluation.
This paper shows that an agent trained without any consideration of the intentions of others is both slower at reaching the goal and results in more collisions.
Four algorithms that use a belief state generated by a particle filter are compared. Two of the algorithms have access to the intention only during training while the others do not. The results show that explicitly trying to predict the intention gave the best performance in terms of safety and efficiency.\\\indent
