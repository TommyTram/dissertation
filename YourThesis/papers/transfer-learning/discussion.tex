\section{Discussions and Future Work}\label{sec:discussion}
In this work, we aim to answer the questions,
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{How can we accurately construct a model using a set of source models for an RL agent deployed in the wild?}
    \item \emph{Does the constructed model allows us to perform efficient planning and yield improvements over learning from scratch?}
\end{enumerate}
Our answer to the first question is by adopting the \emph{Model Transfer Reinforcement Learning} framework and weighting existing knowledge together with data from the novel task. We accomplished this by the way of a maximum likelihood procedure, which resulted in a novel algorithm, MLEMTRL, consisting of a model identification stage and a model-based planning stage. 

The second question is answered by the empirical results in Section~\ref{sec:impacts} and the theoretical results in Section~\ref{sec:bounds}. We can clearly see the model allows for generalisation to novel tasks, given that the tasks are similar enough to the existing task. 

We motivate the use of our framework in settings where an agent is to be deployed in a new domain that is similar to existing, known, domains. We verify the relation of the \emph{regret} w.r.t the model dissimilarity in terms of KL-divergence and the quick, near-optimal performance of the algorithm in the case where the new domain is similar. In addition to this, we prove worst-case performance bounds of the algorithm in both the realisable and non-realisable settings.

\textit{Future work.} An interesting future work is to derive tighter bounds for the \emph{realisable} case in Section~\ref{subsec:realisable}. Note $\delta=0$ in the realisable setting but the large constant $\epsilon$ remains. A concentration bound in the number of samples from the true MDP could be constructed using the proof techniques in~\citet{anastasiou2019normal} and~\citet{ouhamma2022bilinear}. We would also like to investigate larger and more difficult problems. One challenge is devising tractable models in such cases, and to be able to do optimal model-based planning for large scale problems. We would start by considering large problems that can be written as LQR problems, such as~\citep{tunyasuvunakool2020dm_control} and Mujoco~\citep{todorov2012mujoco}.
