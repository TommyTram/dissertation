% As this journey is coming to an end, I realize that the most important memories and experiences are those that I shared with my friends and colleagues along the way. Therefore, it is only right to take a moment to acknowledge the people who have, in different ways, been part of this journey.

% First, I want to thank my supervisor Professor Paolo Falcone. Thank you for always being supportive, for the motivation when times were tough, and for the possibility of pursuing a doctoral degree as your student. It has truly been an honor and a pleasure. I also want to thank my examiner Professor Jonas Sjöberg for accepting and welcoming me in the Mechatronics research group.
 
% Professor Mario Zanon deserves recognition in particular. Mario, I had the privilege to work with you and learn from you during these years. Thank you for all the time and energy you put into this project. I have truly enjoyed all our technical, and non-technical, discussions during these years, and I will always consider you as one of my supervisors, but also as one of my friends.


% I also want to express gratitude to my industrial supervisors Dr.~Nils L\"ubbe and Dr.~Mohammad Ali, who helped guide me through the academic and industrial objectives of my research. Thank you for your support and commitment during all this time. Furthermore, I am grateful that this work was financially supported by Autoliv, Zenuity, Zenseact, and the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program~(WASP); and for the support from my former managers Dr. Erik Rosén, Benny Nilsson, Mats Lestander, and Dr. Mats Nordlund.  I am also grateful for being part of the Advanced Graduate Program at Zenseact under the leadership of Dr. Mats Nordlund and Dr. Carl Lindberg. You have been a great support for me and all PhD students at Zenseact.

% The Chalmers Revere lab deserves special recognition since the experiments in this thesis would not have been possible without it. Therefore, I would like to thank Professor Christian Berger, Dr. Fredrik Von Corswant, and Arpit Karsolia for all the help and support, but also for the great work environment throughout the years. You always turned the lab visits into a great experience.

% I especially want to thank my great friends with whom I started the PhD journey with. Arian Ranjbar, you have been a great office-mate, and you always ensured that it was fun to work from ``skrubben'' (our Chalmers ``office''). Tommy Tram, you have been a great colleague and a great friend throughout this journey. I will always be grateful for your endless support and for all the good times we have shared. I am sure there are more to come. Ankit Gupta, it was impossible to walk past your office without starting some sort of conversation with you. I'm not sure how many hours we spent talking, instead of doing actual research. Thank you for all the good times. Special thanks go to Amrit Krishnan and Fredrik Hoxell for being great friends, and supporting me whenever times were tough. I am also deeply grateful to my friends and colleagues Giuseppe, Robert, Stefan, Krook, John, Daniel, Dapeng, Erik, Emil, Anton, Rui, Lars, Ramin, Simon, Fredrik, Elena, Masoud, Angelos, Angel, Remi, Albert, Carl-Johan, Muhammad, Sten, Maximilian, and the rest of my colleagues from Chalmers, Zenseact, and WASP.


% I would like to thank WASP for all the interesting study trips, courses, and events that not only widened my skills, but also introduced me to a vast network of colleagues and friends across the world. In addition, the WASP exchange program gave me the opportunity to spend six months as a visiting PhD student at the Model Predictive Control Lab at U.C. Berkeley. To that end, I am deeply grateful that Professor Francesco Borrelli gave me the opportunity to spend time and work with his research group. Additionally, special thanks go to the MPC lab, especially to Vijay, Xu, Tommaso, Ugo, and Monimoy, for making my exchange a pleasant and memorable experience.

% Na kraju bih želio posebno zahvaliti svojoj obitelji, ocu Zvonki, majci Marici, sestri Antoniji i bratu Josipu. Osobitu zahvalnost dugujem zaručnici Ivani. Hvala vam svima na beskrajnoj ljubavi i podršci tijekom ovog dijela mog života. Bez vas ovo ne bi bilo moguće.
