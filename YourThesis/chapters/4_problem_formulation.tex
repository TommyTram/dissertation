\chapter{Modeling Intersection Driving Scenarios}
To be able to derive algorithms for decision making we must first describe the mathematical formulation of the problem.  

\section{Intersection scenarios}
\tommy{show examples of intersections.}
\section{State space}
\tommy{Coordinate system, distances to intersection, position, velocity and accelration of other vehicles. abstract away the information about traffic lights, traffic signs, as intention}
\section{Action space}
\tommy{options, take way, give way, follow car}
short term goals presented in \paperLSTM.
\section{Transistion model}
\tommy{IDM, and other agents behaviors/intentions.}
\subsection{Simulation scenarios or simulator}
parameters, randomized cars. Behaviors. spawn rates and more. up to four cars. 
\section{Observation model}
\tommy{Everything in the state space except intention. Everything that is observable through the sensors in the car. }
\section{Reward function}
designing the reward model from the objective we are trying to achieve. this is not the optimal values. We are starting of a relative reward difference around 0 and 1. Then hand tune to get a performance close to the desired outcome. 
\section{Discussion}
