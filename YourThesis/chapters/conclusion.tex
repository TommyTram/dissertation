\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}

1. RL by itself still has a long way to guarantee safety, but the methods presented in this paper. the unncertainty can be reduced. safety is better suited for contrl or formal methods. RL is a great tool for creating policy that can adapt to different driver interntions. 
2. Even with todays advancements in \gls{nn} DQN still has a hard time handling
