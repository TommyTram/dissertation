\section{State representation}
This section describe the general state representation used in this research that enables these methods to be generalizable for different type of intersection and crossings. 
By describing the state space as a set of distances to intersection points, we can abstract the map layout of different intersections and the same algorithms would work for intersections variations that we havent specifically trained on.

\section{MPC}
\section{Approach}
MPC has a mixed integer problem, calculating the optimal path for all possible action is very computationally heavy. 
RL DQN. Only has descret actions. can not garantee safety. but is good at choosing actions with the best utility (value). 
The reward function takes in the predicted outcome of the model in the MPC and can penalize the choice of action. but if experience show that the outcome is better than the model, it can choose to take a bad action that would lead to a better total reward compared to only following a conservative model. 

\section{Simulated experiments}
We show the difference in a multi crossing scenario where the MPC can plan a path for both intersections while our previous DQN only handles one at a time.
